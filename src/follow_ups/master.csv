that one never leaves my lips...
"don't ask me why, but I mean it..."
and who am I to stop repeating it?...
you know I’ve been saying this for ages...
I mutter it under my breath constantly...
even the owls roll their eyes when I say it again...
you’ll find me scribbling that in the margins...
and I’ll keep saying it until the stars grow tired...
"the sparrows are sick of hearing it, honestly..."
I’ll embroider that on every cloud if I must...
"and if you wait, I'll say it again louder..."
the moss already knows I say it too much...
I shout it at my tea when no one’s listening...
the lanterns flicker every time I whisper it...
I’ve been humming that since yesterday’s tomorrow...
and the stones already know it by heart...
"whispered in every shadow, if you listen..."
"a truth older than the wind, I assure you..."
the moon nods each time I repeat it...
and the rivers echo it without end...
you’ll hear it again when the fog returns...
and that’s carved into the silence itself...
the night itself leans closer when I say it...
even the roots beneath your feet remember it...
and the horizon sighs each time I speak it...
you’ll see it written in the dust of forgotten books...
and the dream you lost yesterday still carries it...
the tide itself bows whenever I repeat it...
and it’s the first thing dawn asks the sun...
"the stars are tired of me repeating it, but they agree..."
Trickster & Funny-Mysterious...
"and if I didn't say it, who would?..."
"the squirrels begged me not to repeat it, but I must..."
"and yes, I'll deny ever saying it, but I just did..."
the crows laugh every time I insist on it...
"and yet, I swear I heard you say it first..."
don’t look at me — the mushrooms told me to say it...
and I’ll keep chanting it until it annoys you...
that one even makes the shadows roll their eyes...
the cats claim I stole it from them...
I carved that into the wind just last Tuesday...
and I’ll deny it again when you ask me later...
the foxes told me it sounds better in whispers...
and I’m fairly sure it’s a riddle in disguise...
"I tried not to say it, but it escaped..."
the chimney smoke always carries it away from me...
and the clock strikes nonsense when I say it...
the broom in the corner has heard me say it a thousand times...
and don’t tell the mirrors I said it again...
"I swore to the clouds I'd stop repeating it, but here we are..."
and the crickets chirp louder every time I finish it...
the wind already tattled that I’d say it...
and the ink dries faster whenever I speak it...
I would’ve written it on the moon if I could reach...
and I’ll slip it into your next dream...
the trees gossip that I overuse it...
and I’ll hum it until your shoes remember it...
the candle burns brighter when I repeat it...
and the shadows bow politely afterward...
even the clocks chuckle when I say it again...
and the sky pretends not to hear me...
the leaves have memorized me saying it by now...
and I’ll say it again just to confuse myself...
"the horizon asked me to stop, but I can't..."
and the clouds roll their eyes whenever I mutter it...
the owls sigh every time they hear me say it...
and I’ll stitch it into the silence between us...
the teapots told me to keep repeating it...
and the soil whispers it back when I’m not looking...
"I once painted it on the rain, badly..."
and the stars giggle each time I declare it...
even my shadow is sick of me saying it...
"and still, I'll claim it as my favorite sentence..."
I let it slip while talking to the lightning...
and the echoes refuse to stop carrying it...
the moon humors me every single time I repeat it...
and now we said it...
