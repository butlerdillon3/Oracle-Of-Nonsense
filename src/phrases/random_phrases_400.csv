A broken ladder still reaches higher than the ground
You can’t plant apples and expect oranges
You can’t drink from an empty cup
A ship in harbor still rocks with the tide
The river flows even when no one listens
The tallest wall is useless without a door
Even a painted bird knows it can’t fly
A broken ladder still reaches higher than the ground when no one is watching
Even the empty basket has weight between two heartbeats
Even a locked book holds a story where the river bends
A hill becomes a mountain if you stand far enough between two heartbeats
A cracked cup still holds rain
You can’t measure the sky with a ruler
You can’t store time in a box
The clock’s face hides its gears on a windy day
The deepest well reflects the smallest star
Even a straight stick casts a crooked shadow
A key in the wrong lock still turns beyond the last hill
A broken net still catches the wind where the river bends
The smallest pebble can trip the tallest man where the river bends
A cold fire can still leave ashes where the river bends
A sleeping dog still dreams of running
Even the loudest voice fades with distance
A quiet drum can still be felt
A key in the wrong lock still turns where the river bends
A door half-open is still half-closed when no one is watching
A cold fire can still leave ashes
The moon doesn’t mind being second to the sun
A closed window still sees the rain
The sun doesn’t race the clock before the dawn
Even the straightest road can feel long when no one is watching
The tallest candle burns the fastest
The sun doesn’t race the clock under the old tree
A chair without legs still casts a shadow
A bent road still leads somewhere under the old tree
A door half-open is still half-closed
A chair without legs still casts a shadow under the old tree
The darkest night still has a horizon when no one is watching
The heaviest rain starts with one drop
A bent road still leads somewhere
You can’t sweep dust from the wind under the old tree
You can’t wear a crown made of water
A torn sail can still catch the breeze where the river bends
The darkest night still has a horizon
The clock’s face hides its gears
The darkest night still has a horizon on a windy day
Even the loudest voice fades with distance when no one is watching
Even the straightest road can feel long between two heartbeats
A hill becomes a mountain if you stand far enough
You can’t drink from an empty cup beyond the last hill
Even a straight stick casts a crooked shadow when no one is watching
The loudest clock keeps the same hours under the old tree
You can’t row with one oar in the water when no one is watching
You can’t row with one oar in the water
A cracked cup still holds rain where the river bends
You can’t climb a mountain without touching it
You can’t teach the wind where to blow
The smallest pebble can trip the tallest man
A sleeping dog still dreams of running under the old tree
A torn sail can still catch the breeze
A frozen river still has a current at the edge of the map
The empty chair waits without complaint
A broken net still catches the wind
A ship in harbor still rocks with the tide at the edge of the map
You can’t sweep dust from the wind beyond the last hill
The sun doesn’t race the clock
You can’t push a rope uphill
The river flows even when no one listens before the dawn
You can’t sweep dust from the wind
A broken net still catches the wind at the edge of the map
Even the straightest road can feel long
A sleeping dog still dreams of running in the dark
The deepest well reflects the smallest star on a windy day
A tree in the desert still makes shade
A door half-open is still half-closed under the old tree
The heaviest rain starts with one drop beyond the last hill
Even a locked book holds a story beyond the last hill
Even a dull knife can point the way
You can’t measure the sky with a ruler between two heartbeats
Even the empty basket has weight before the dawn
A tree in the desert still makes shade at the edge of the map
A door half-open is still half-closed on a windy day
Even a locked book holds a story
The deepest well reflects the smallest star under the old tree
A lamp without oil still remembers the flame
A cage with no bird still feels heavy between two heartbeats
Even a painted bird knows it can’t fly where the river bends
A key in the wrong lock still turns
The loudest clock keeps the same hours
The smallest spark can blind in darkness
Even a locked book holds a story at the edge of the map
A kite can’t fly without its string
A cage with no bird still feels heavy
A broken ladder still reaches higher than the ground under the old tree
The deepest well reflects the smallest star beyond the last hill
The smallest pebble can trip the tallest man beyond the last hill
Even the empty basket has weight when no one is watching
